## ABOUT ME 
I enjoy learning new things every day. I am learning programming logic in a variety of ways since there are always new problems that arise. 
Any programmer must be able to analyze these issues and find solutions to the smaller divide-and-conquer problems.

By the way, my major objective is to become a software developer and web developer so that I may construct an application and 
website for any client needs new website or something way.Â
